//! Bridging OpenBubbles' on-disk format to rustpush `main`.
//!
//! rustpush changed how RSA private keys are stored. Older builds — including
//! the OpenBubbles 1.15.0 that produced our registration — wrote the key
//! material inline:
//!
//!     keypair = { cert: <data>, private: <data> }   // DER, inline
//!
//! `main` moved private keys behind a keystore abstraction and now stores only
//! a label, because on Android and iOS the key lives in hardware and can never
//! be extracted:
//!
//!     keypair = { cert: <data>, private: "some-alias" }
//!
//! `RsaKey` is a newtype over that alias, so deserialising the old shape fails
//! with "invalid value: byte array, expected a string".
//!
//! The fix is to meet it where it is. We walk the plist, and every time we see
//! a `{cert, private}` pair with inline `private` bytes, we import those bytes
//! into a software keystore under a deterministic alias and swap the inline
//! data for that alias. What comes out the far side is the shape `main`
//! expects, and deserialisation proceeds untouched.
//!
//! Aliases are derived from a digest of the key itself rather than from its
//! position in the tree. Position is not stable — services come and go from
//! `registration` across renewals — but a key's own bytes are, so re-importing
//! is idempotent and a re-import after renewal doesn't strand the old entries.
//!
//! EC keys are unaffected: `IDSNGMIdentity` still serialises those inline via
//! `CompactECKey`, so `hw_info.plist`'s `identity` block loads as-is.
