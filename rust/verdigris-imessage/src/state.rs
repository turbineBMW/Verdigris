//! Loading the iMessage identity that OpenBubbles registered for us.
//!
//! We deliberately do not register with Apple ourselves. Registration needs
//! "validation data", which is produced by Apple's NAC crypto — implemented
//! upstream in `open-absinthe`, a *closed-source* crate that ships here only
//! as a non-functional stub. So `rustpush::register()` cannot work in this
//! build, and any code path reaching it will fail.
//!
//! What we can do is adopt a registration somebody else completed. OpenBubbles
//! stores its rustpush state as two plists, and they are exactly our types:
//!
//!     hw_info.plist   /os_config  → MacOSConfig   (the rented Mac's identity)
//!                     /push       → APSState      (APNs token + client cert)
//!                     /identity   → IDSNGMIdentity(device/pre/legacy keys)
//!     id.plist        (root)      → Vec<IDSUser>  (Apple ID + per-service
//!                                                  IDS certs and handles)
//!
//! `IDSUser::registration` is what makes this work: once OpenBubbles has
//! registered, that map holds a live `id_keypair` per service, and sending
//! only needs those — never `register()`.
//!
//! The catch is expiry. Registrations carry `registered_at_s` and lapse after
//! roughly a month, and renewing means registering again, which lands back on
//! the validation-data problem. So renewal stays OpenBubbles' job: run it,
//! let it re-register, and re-import. `registration_age` exists to warn about
//! that before sends start failing.
