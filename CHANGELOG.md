# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

Two subsystems that did not exist at 0.1.0, plus the app that renders them.

### Added
- **Direct iMessage transport** (`ib-imessage`, Rust) — speaks to Apple through
  rustpush over its own systemd unit, giving guids, replies, edits, unsends,
  tapbacks, typing indicators, attachments and receipts. MAP carries none of
  these; it delivers incoming text and nothing more.
- **Qt/QML desktop app** (`iphonebridge-qt`), replacing the GTK4 app.
- **iOS backup import** (`iphonebridge backup-sync`), normalizing `sms.db` into
  the same event shape the daemon emits.
- Cross-transport deduplication: the same message arrives over MAP and iMessage
  with no shared identifier, so matching is heuristic and only ever applied
  across differing transports.
- Delivery/read state and edit history persisted as `message_state` rows, so
  captions and post-edit text survive a restart.

### Fixed
- Stickers that sit inside a message (U+FFFC in the body) are drawn inline in
  the bubble instead of as a free-standing attachment above a caption that
  still showed the placeholder glyph.
- A reset APNs connection left the helper alive and serving with nothing behind
  it: sends still worked and status still read "available" while no inbound
  message arrived again. The helper now exits so systemd rebuilds the
  connection, and the daemon treats the loss as loss of transport.
- Desktop notifications never closed on the iMessage path. The only automatic
  close was a BlueZ MAP property change, which an iMessage does not produce.

### Removed
- The GTK4/libadwaita app and its desktop entry.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-19

First tagged release. Working iphonebridge daemon on Pop!_OS 24.04
against iPhone 16 Pro Max running iOS 26.5.

### Confirmed working
- Real-time SMS + iMessage notifications via MAP MNS push
- Outgoing SMS + iMessage send via MAP `PushMessage` — iOS auto-routes
  as iMessage when the recipient is iMessage-capable
- 1000+ contacts pulled via PBAP, cached in SQLite, name-resolved for
  incoming messages
- systemd user service for autostart, graceful degradation when iPhone
  toggles are off, automatic retry every 60s
- DBus service `com.gabriel.iphonebridge.Messages1` with Send,
  ListRecent, IsHealthy methods
- CLI: `run`, `doctor`, `pair-setup`, `sms-list`, `sms-send`,
  `contacts-sync`, `version`

### Documented constraints (won't change)
- No iMessage attachments / reactions / read receipts / typing
  indicators (MAP doesn't expose them)
- No group iMessage / MMS / RCS (MAP is 1:1 only)
- No outgoing call audio routing (HFP HF role — Phase 2c)

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-20

### Verification codes auto-copied to the clipboard

- When an incoming text carries a one-time / 2FA code, the daemon detects it
  and copies it straight to the system clipboard, with a short "Code copied"
  notification — paste with Ctrl+V, no reaching for the phone. New
  `ClipboardSink`.
- Detection requires a verification keyword *and* a 4-8 digit number, so an
  ordinary text that just happens to contain a number doesn't trigger.
- Uses `wl-copy` (Wayland) or `xclip` / `xsel` (X11) — install `wl-clipboard`
  for the Wayland path.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-20

### Sent messages in conversation history

- The daemon now records every message sent through iphonebridge (the UI
  compose box or `iphonebridge sms-send`) to `events.jsonl` as a `sms_sent`
  event, and broadcasts a `MessageSent` signal on `Events1`. The UI threads
  these in, so a conversation shows both sides — incoming **and** the replies
  you sent from the desktop.
- No desktop notification fires for your own sent messages.
- Note: messages composed on the iPhone itself remain invisible — iOS does
  not expose sent content over MAP (the `sent` folder is empty, and no MNS
  push fires for outgoing). This was verified empirically; see the commit.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-20

### Phase 2d — GTK4 / libadwaita desktop app

- **`iphonebridge-ui`** — a standalone GTK4 / libadwaita app, separate from
  the daemon, talking to it over D-Bus. Four surfaces:
  - **Messages** — SMS/iMessage threads with history and a compose box
  - **Notifications** — a live feed of per-app ANCS notifications
  - **Calls** — a dialer plus answer / hang-up controls for active calls
  - **Setup** — daemon health, data counts, and the iPhone-toggle checklist
- New `src/iphonebridge/ui/` package; `DaemonClient` subscribes to the
  daemon's live signals and reads history from `events.jsonl`.
- Daemon broadcasts a live event feed on a new D-Bus interface
  `com.gabriel.iphonebridge.Events1` (`MessageReceived`, `MessageSeen`,
  `AncsNotification` signals) for the UI to consume.
- `data/` — `.desktop` entry, AppStream metainfo, and an app icon.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-20

### Phase 2c — HFP Hands-Free calls

- **Take and place iPhone calls on the laptop.** New `src/iphonebridge/hfp/`
  subsystem: call control runs through oFono (`org.ofono`, system bus), and
  call audio (SCO) rides PipeWire's oFono HFP backend.
- Incoming calls raise a desktop notification with **Answer / Decline**
  buttons; caller ID is resolved against the contacts cache.
- New CLI: `call <number|contact>`, `hangup`, `calls`, and `hfp-enable`
  (writes the WirePlumber config that routes HFP through oFono).
- New D-Bus interface `com.gabriel.iphonebridge.Calls1` — `Dial`,
  `AnswerCall`, `HangupCall`, `HangupAll`, `ListCalls`, and a
  `CallStateChanged` signal.
- Daemon: sinks now initialise independently of the MAP/PBAP sessions, so
  ANCS and call notifications reach the desktop even in degraded mode.
- Empirically confirmed against iPhone 16 Pro Max / iOS 26.5 — including
  **3/3 reliable outgoing dials**, which overturns the old "HFP HF can't
  reliably ATD on iPhone" assumption. See `spike/05b_hfp_ofono.py` and the
  HFP addendum in `spike/RESULTS.md`.
- `pyproject.toml`: `testpaths = ["tests"]` so a bare `pytest` no longer
  recurses (and hangs on) the whole repo tree.

## [Unreleased]

### Project-defining discoveries (2026-05-19, post-launch)

- **Incoming iMessage IS exposed via MAP on iOS 26.5 / iPhone 16 Pro Max**, labeled as `Type: sms-gsm` indistinguishably from SMS. This contradicts every prior Bluetooth-on-Linux writeup. Verified: sender (Contact B, confirmed iMessage thread, both on iPhone) sent "test-iphonebridge-XYZ123" → daemon received and rendered the body within ~2s.

- **Outgoing iMessage via MAP `PushMessage` ALSO works.** Tested via `spike/07_map_send.py`: constructed a minimal bMessage (originator + BENV-wrapped recipient VCARD), called `MessageAccess1.PushMessage(sourcefile, "telecom/msg/outbox", {})` — transfer completed, the iPhone's outgoing bubble appeared **blue** (iMessage) in the recipient thread.

Together: **iphonebridge is potentially the first free open-source Linux iMessage bridge that does not require a Mac relay**. README, BACKLOG, RESULTS.md updated accordingly.

### Phase 1 — MVP daemon (2026-05-19)
- Working iphonebridge daemon: BLE-advert / CoD startup dance, long-lived MAP + PBAP sessions, MAP MNS push subscription, bMessage parsing, SQLite contacts cache, libnotify + JSONL sinks.
- Typer CLI: `run`, `doctor`, `sms-list`, `contacts-sync`, `version`.
- systemd user service for auto-start.
- sudoers.d entry (`install-cod-sudoers.sh`) for passwordless `btmgmt class 4 8` so CoD survives reboots.
- End-to-end verified: SMS from a known contact arrives as a GNOME desktop notification within ~20 ms of the iPhone push.

### Phase 0 — Empirical spike (2026-05-19)
- Confirmed against iPhone 16 Pro Max / iOS 26.5: MAP read ✓, MAP MNS push ✓, PBAP (1957 contacts) ✓, HFP HF role partial (needs WirePlumber config work), ANCS deferred (needs BLE-only pairing flow incompatible with the BR/EDR pair MAP/PBAP need).
- Documented non-obvious findings in `spike/RESULTS.md`: the hidden-toggle dance, single-OBEX-session-per-fresh-obexd, SMS body in `Subject`, PBAP `Select` vs `SetFolder`, BR/EDR-vs-BLE pairing mutex for ANCS.
